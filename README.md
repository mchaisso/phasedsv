Phased-SV
=========

Local assembly based SV detection using single-molecule sequencing reads
and a phased SNV VCF file.

Summary
-------

This software pipeline performs SV calling with four main steps:
1. Local assembly of haplotype-partitioned reads.
2. Merging of local assemblies into a reference-guided assembly.
3. Mapping merged assemblies to the reference.
4. Filtering SVs by read-support of breakpoints.
