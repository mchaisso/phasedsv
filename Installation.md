Installing Phased-SV.

Most dependencies are installed using bioconda. The remaining software
requires gcc >= 7.0 to build.

2. Setup biocona environments and build binaries. The full tree and
dependencies will be built by typing 

`make` in the phasedsv directory.  This takes some time, and necessary
modules will be downloaded.
